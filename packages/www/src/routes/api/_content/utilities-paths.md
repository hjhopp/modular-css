### Path resolver

A resolver for [`modular-css`](https://github.com/tivac/modular-css) that will let you resolve file references against arbitrary paths. Useful to avoid code like

```
@value foo from "../../../../../../../../some/other/directory/file.css";
```

which is annoying to write, annoying to read, and also super-brittle.

#### Install

`$ npm i @modular-css/path-resolver`

#### Usage

Pass as part of the `resolvers` array in the `modular-css` options (via JS API/Rollup/Browserify/WebPack/etc). When `modular-css` is trying to resolve `@value` or `composes` file references it'll use the default node resolution algorithm against whichever paths you specified.

```js
const Processor = require("@modular-css/processor");
const paths     = require("@modular-css/path-resolver");

const processor = new Processor({
    resolvers : [
        paths({
            paths : [
                "./path/one",
                "../../some/other/path"
            ]
        })
    ]
});
```

#### Options

##### `paths`

An array of string file paths, they can be relative to the `cwd` of the `Processor` instance or absolute paths.
