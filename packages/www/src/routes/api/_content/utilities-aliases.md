### Path Aliasing

A resolver for modular-css that will let you resolve file references against named aliases. Useful to avoid code like

```
@value foo from "../../../../../../../../some/other/directory/file.css";
```

which is annoying to write, annoying to read, and also super-brittle.

#### Install

`$ npm i @modular-css/path-aliases --save-dev`

#### Usage

Pass as part of the `resolvers` array in the `modular-css` options (via JS API/Rollup/Browserify/WebPack/etc). When `modular-css` is trying to resolve `@value` or `composes` file references it'll replace the alias keys with their path value for file lookups.

```js
import  Processor from "@modular-css/processor";
import aliases from "@modular-css/path-aliases";

const processor = new Processor({
    resolvers : [
        aliases({
            aliases : {
                one  : "./path/one",
                path : "../../some/other/path"
            }
        })
    ]
});
```

which allows you to write CSS like this.

```css
@value one from "one/one.css";

.a {
    composes: path from "path/path.css";
}
```

#### Options

##### `aliases`

A `object` consisting of key/value pairs of alias names to file paths. Paths can be relative to the `cwd` of the `Processor` instance or absolute paths.
