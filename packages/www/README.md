# @modular-css/www

Code + content that becomes m-css.com

## Building

From the root, `npm run www:build` will build a static copy of the site to the `packages/www/dist` folder.

`npm run www:start` will start a rollup watcher as well as a server.

## Hosting

Site is hosted by netlify.com, auto-builds and deploys from the `main` branch. Should keep it up to date with future releases.

## TODO

- [ ] Allow for giving new REPL tabs a name
- [ ] Figure out how to get REPL build to not output CSS
